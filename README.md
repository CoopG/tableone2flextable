# tableone2flextable

This repository contains two functions that allow you to convert a tableone object to a flextable object and then export this flextable object as a word document containing a table that you can insert into publications, etc.

It also contains an example R script using the mtcars dataset to demonstrate the functionality.

This code requires the following libraries:

* tidyverse
* flextable
* officer

Please make good use of this and feel free to make a pull request if you notice any errors in the code or have ideas for improvement!
